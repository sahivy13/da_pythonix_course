# PYTHONIX COURSE (DATA ANALYTICS)

![python_logo_image](https://wallpaperplay.com/walls/full/5/e/b/77588.jpg#.XpO2xwK4IKk.link)

## Description

I created this course to be able to teach my little sister, and anyone else that wants to learn from me.

My aim is to create a step by step guided course that will allow the student to learn the basics of python, and then have one on one sessions with me to get deeper into more complex subjects.

This repo will evolve as the language changes, and as I evolve as a programmer.

## Structure

1. Requirements
2. Course
3. Homework
4. Projects

## Requirements

The following need to be installed in your PC or Mac:

1. Python -> make sure that you also have the updated version

2. Jupyter Notebook -> this is a notebook like platform to write code in cells, in order for it to be excuted one by one rather than executing the entire file at once. The scripts are written as .ipynb files, which are still python scripts. These type of files are helpful for begginers, but you will be coding in .py files once you understand the basics.

3. Additional installations will be required as you move along the course, but these will be in the README.md file for every module.

## Course

In order to get started, you will need to make a fork of this repo in your Github account. Once you have done so, then clone your forked repository in order for you to have the files in your local drive.

Now move through the guided course starting with concept 0.

## Homework

The homework will not be evaluated, but instead this is for your to practice and then I will be able to give you feed back. Welcome to 2020, where grades don't matter and college is dying. The homework you will be doing are things you will actually be applying in the industry, and there is no right or wrong way to do it... thus let your imagination go wild after and keep learning.

## Projects

The projects will have the same goal as the homework, but these will not be guided. They will be aimed to let your imaginatioin go wild with the tools given as you progress through the course.
