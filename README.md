## Description

I created this course to be able to teach my little sister, and anyone else that wants to learn from me.

My aim is to create a step by step guided course that will allow the student to learn the basics of python, and then have one on one sessions with me to get deeper into more complex subjects.

This repo will evolve as the language changes, and as I evolve as a programmer.
